# a new machine-learning based diagnostic tool for differentiation of dermatoscopic skin cancer images.
We developed an application to enable researchers to assess our skin cancer classification model and load their images to this app to get the results instantly.  Please note that this application has no clinical or diagnostic value and is for research purposes only.<br>
This computer vision program classify dermatoscopic images of skin cancer lesions. We have used the HAM10000 MNIST dataset to train my model. The model's backbone is EfficientNetB1 and a Global average pooling 2D layer is added on top.

Here are the results: accuracy on test set 84.3%
## Dataset description

This population contains information about 10015 participants with the mean age of 51.86Â±16.96 which was only reported for 9958 of cases.
The biological sex of the 5406 (54.1%) of participants were Male, 4552 (45.5%) were Female, and for 57 (0.6%) of them the gender was unknown.
The skin lesion images were taken from various parts of the body. The back with 2192(21.9%) images, the lower extremities with 2077(20.7 %) images,
the trunk with 1404(14.0%) images, the upper extremities with 1118(11.2%) images, and the abdomen with 1022(10.2) images were the 5 most involved parts of the body;
other ports prevalence in described in the Figure bellow.
The diagnosis for each lesion was confirmed via a specific route, 5340(53.3%) of lesions were confirmed through histopathologic examinations,
3704(37.0%) of lesions were confirmed by follow-up examinations, 902(9.0%) of lesions were confirmed by expert consensus, and the ground truth for 69(0.7%) of lesions was confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy.
